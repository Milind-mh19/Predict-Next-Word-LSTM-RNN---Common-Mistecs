# Predict-Next-Word-LSTM-RNN---Common-Mistecs
This repository is a guide to the most common "mistecs" (yes, intentional!) encountered when building next-word prediction models using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) RNNs. This collection dives into frequent issues with text preprocessing, model architecture, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics.
